		 			You gotta know, I'm feeling love
					Made of gold, I'll never love a
					Another one, another you
					It's gotta be love I said it

					You gotta know, I'm feeling love
					You gotta know, I'm feeling love

					You gotta know, I'm feeling love
					Made of gold, I'll never love a
					Another one, another you
					It's gotta be love I said it

					I might as well be in a garden
					I said, ah
					A smell in the air is a dripp in the waters 
					(you could be the one for me)
					Another soul to meet my void then
					Of anything bare that's made of gold

		 			A physical kiss is nothing without it
					And you close your eyes to see what it's done
					The body that lies is built up on looking
					Cause all that remains before it's begun

					You gotta know, I'm feeling love
					Made of gold, I'll never love a
					Another one, another you
					It's gotta be love, I said it

					You gotta know, I'm feeling love
					Made of gold, I'll never love a
					Another one, another you
					It's gotta be love, I said it

					A heart will swell before it's hardened
					With the flick of the hair, it can make you old
					Another hole to dig my soul in
					I'll leave anything bare that keeps me soul
